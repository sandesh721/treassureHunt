// You are traveling on the highway, where a speedometer is installed. The speedometer's sensor records the entry and exit times of a car. Given that the car is 3 meters long, how would you calculate the speed of the car as a programmer?

// entry and exit time is in seconds, lengthOfCar is in meters
// converting m/s to km/hr is 18/5;

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    float entryTime = 0.0;
    float exitTime = 0.127;
    int lengthOfCar = 3;

    // Output should be in int
    

    // Convert the speed to character
    return 0;
}
