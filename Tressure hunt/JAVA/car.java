// You are traveling on the highway, where a speedometer is installed. The speedometer's sensor records the entry and exit times of a car. Given that the car is 3 meters long, how would you calculate the speed of the car as a programmer?

// entry and exit time is in seconds, lengthOfCar is in meters
// converting m/s to km/hr is 18/5;
public class car {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        float entryTime = 0.0f;
        float exitTime = 0.127f;
        int lengthOfCar = 3;
        
        // Output should be in int
    

        // Convert the speed to character
    }
}
