You are traveling on the highway, where a speedometer is installed. The speedometer's sensor records the entry and exit times of a car. Given that the car is 3 meters long, how would you calculate the speed of the car as a programmer?
Note: Use the character to unlock the file named array

entry and exit time is in seconds, lengthOfCar is in meters
converting m/s to km/hr is 18/5;

entryTime = 0
exitTime = 0.127
lengthOfCar = 3

Output should be in int

Convert the speed to character
